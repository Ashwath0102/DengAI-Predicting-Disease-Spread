## **DengAI Predicting Disease Spread Competition**

Hey there! üëã As a fellow participant in the DengAI Predicting Disease Spread competition hosted by DrivenData, I'm excited to share my journey and insights into this captivating challenge. In this repository, I've explored various models and techniques to predict the spread of dengue fever in San Juan and Iquitos, aiming for accuracy and precision in my predictions.

#### **Problem Statement**

In this competition, organized by DrivenData, the goal is to predict the total number of dengue fever cases in San Juan and Iquitos. Given a wide array of environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, our task is to predict the disease spread accurately. The competition provides a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems, honing our skills and contributing to the fight against diseases.

#### **Code Descriptions**


###### 1. Random Forest Regressor

I started with a Random Forest Regressor, leveraging its ability to handle complex relationships in the data. The model was trained using various features and was a foundation for further exploration.

###### 2. GradientBoostingRegressor, Ridge Regression & XGBoost Regressor

Exploring ensemble methods, I implemented GradientBoostingRegressor, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost Regressor. These models excel at capturing intricate patterns and provided substantial improvements in prediction accuracy.

###### 3. Deep Learning Model

A deep learning model with 5 hidden layers was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. This neural network was designed to capture intricate non-linear relationships in the data, enhancing the prediction accuracy significantly.

###### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning for Deep Learning

I employed hyperparameter tuning techniques like learning rate scheduling and dropout rate adjustments. These dynamic adjustments during training improved the model's convergence and prediction accuracy.

###### 5. Random Forest Regressor + Deep Learning Model Ensemble

To harness the strengths of both Random Forest and Deep Learning models, I created an ensemble. By extracting features from the Random Forest Regressor and using them as inputs for the Deep Learning model, I achieved a balance between model complexity and accuracy.

#### **Competition Explanation**

The DengAI Predicting Disease Spread competition by DrivenData provides a unique opportunity to apply data science skills to real-world problems. By predicting disease spread accurately, we contribute to understanding and mitigating the impact of diseases on communities. The challenge is not just about winning but about collaborating, learning, and making a difference.
